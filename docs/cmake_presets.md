# CMake Presets

CMake Presets is a "standard" way in cmake to share settings with other people.

Read more about CMake presets from [CMake docs](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/cmake-presets.7.html).

**Attention:** Support for CMake Presets takes top priority, so if "cmake\[-user\]-presets.json" or "CMake\[User\]Presets.json" is provided, then cmake kits and cmake variants won't have any effect.
